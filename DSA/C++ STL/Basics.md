    Containers
        Sequential
            Vectors
            Stack
            Queue
            Pair
        Ordered
            Map
            Multimap
            Set
            MultiSet
        Unordered
            Unoredred Map
            Unordered Set    

    Iterators
        Point to memory address of containers
        begin(), end()
        eg. vector<int>:: iterator it;

    Algorithms
        Upper bound
        Lower bound
        Sort (Comparator)
        max element
        min element
        accumulate
        reverse
        count
        find
        next permutations
        prev permutations

    Functors
        classes which can act as functions
